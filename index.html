    <h1>Hello! I am Cheng-You Ho</h1>
    <p>I'm currently a student '25 of Chiayi Senior High School in Taiwan. My hobbies are music composition, chess and coding. 
        I also pursue physics in my leisure time, by leading a 2024 Taiwan Young Physicists' Tournament team, doing science fairs in Physics and Astronomy, and working to be a part of
        the 2024 national IPhO team of Chinese Taipei. 
    </p>
