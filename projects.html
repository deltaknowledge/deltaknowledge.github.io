    <h3>Analyzing the Composition of RR Lyrae Variables in Globular Clusters with GAIA Data</h3>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Authors. </span>Cheng-You Ho, 黃冠夫</p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract. </span>Globular clusters are dense, low-metallicity star clusters. These objects are home to most RR Lyrae Variables, which are important in determining the evolution of star clusters. Although considerable research has been devoted discussing their period and luminosities, the composition of RR Lyrae stars within globular clusters remains an area of investigation. Using the GAIA Data Release 3 database, a heatmap of the surrounding stars of the target cluster is first depicted, which the apparent dimensions of the cluster and an estimated number of observed stars in the cluster is inferred. Then, the composition of RR Lyrae stars in 20 globular clusters are analyzed. It is concluded that three factors play an essential role in deciding the raio of RR Lyrae Variables to the number of stars in the home cluster, which are the cluster age, cluster radii and metallicity, listed in order of descending impact. Various hypotheses concerning the mechanism of these parameters are proposed. Quantaties combining the effect of the three parameters are defined, enabling the RR Lyrae composition to help determine properties of the star clusters. The special cases that deviate from the main trend are discussed. The differences of the apparent magnitude obtained with the concept of heatmaps and that from the refences are also analyzed.</p>
